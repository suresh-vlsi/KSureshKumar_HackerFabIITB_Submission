## 1. Motivation and design choice

A semiconductor-processing hot plate must do more than reach a high temperature. It must control temperature accurately, maintain uniformity across a 4-inch wafer, repeat process runs consistently, and preserve surface flatness after thermal cycling. This proposal uses a 160 mm diameter heat-spreader plate, four nominal 250 W cartridge heaters arranged in two independently controlled zones, two 4-wire Pt100 sensors, insulation, and independent hardware protection.

A thick aluminium plate is a cost-conscious prototype starting point because it spreads heat laterally and is straightforward to machine. The main risk is distortion at elevated temperature and loss of the original 6061-T6 temper. Therefore, the flatness requirement is a validation gate, not a claim of success. A qualified workshop must approve the material condition, thermal treatment and final machining route.

## 2. Design overview

- **Finished plate target:** Ø160 × 20 mm.
- **Heater power:** 4 × 250 W = 1 kW nominal; two 500 W zones.
- **Temperature feedback:** two 4-wire Pt100 sensors and an RTD interface.
- **Control:** ramp-limited, two-zone PID with data logging.
- **Independent safety:** over-temperature cut-out, contactor, emergency stop, protective earthing, overcurrent protection and guarded mains terminals.
- **Thermal management:** underside and side insulation, plus repeatable wafer supports.
- **Validation:** accuracy, wafer-area uniformity, run-to-run repeatability and flatness are tested separately.

## 3. First-order calculation results

Run `python3 calcs/thermal_calc.py` from the repository root.

The model estimates about 1.09 kg plate mass, 973 J/K heat capacity, 365 kJ to heat from 25 °C to 400 °C, and 304 W ideal average power for a 20-minute ramp before losses. Estimated 400 °C losses are around 172 W under the stated assumptions. These figures support considering 1 kW installed power, but do not prove the ramp time, uniformity or repeatability.

## 4. How the specifications will be tested

- **Accuracy:** compare setpoint to a calibrated reference at 100, 200, 300 and 400 °C; absolute error must be below 5 °C.
- **Uniformity:** map the wafer footprint at multiple points; maximum minus minimum must be no more than 1.0 °C at each tested setpoint.
- **Repeatability:** conduct ten repeat runs with a fixed ramp/soak and wafer position; report max–min and standard deviation.
- **Flatness:** measure the top surface at multiple points after machining and after thermal cycling; state the tolerance definition and measurement uncertainty.

The consolidated engineering report describes the proposed validation approach. Detailed acceptance criteria must be finalised before physical testing.

## 5. Main challenges and mitigation

1. **Plate warpage at 400 °C:** use a qualified material/thermal-conditioning route, finish-grind after stress relief, cycle the assembly and re-measure.
2. **Edge temperature drop:** use two zones, insulation and a wafer-area temperature map to tune the edge zone.
3. **Sensor bias and drift:** use 4-wire RTDs, reference calibration, fixed sensor depth and periodic drift checks.
4. **Repeatability:** standardise ramp rate, soak criterion, wafer support and measurement protocol.
5. **Mains and hot-surface hazards:** use an independent hardware cutoff, contactor, protective earth and correctly rated protection; obtain a qualified electrical review.

## 6. Budget and limitations

The current budgetary BOM estimate is approximately ₹46,700 before tax, shipping, labour, certification and rework. All costs require supplier/workshop quotes. The thermal model is first-order; final heater geometry requires verification against the dimensioned drawing and may need FEA or iterative testing. No performance specification should be described as achieved until measured data demonstrates it.
